# PR: Improve TEL Integration with Effect System

## Summary
This PR addresses and verifies the Temporal Effect Language (TEL) integration with the core effect system. It specifically focuses on ensuring `toEffect` correctly uses `CompositeEffect` for handling composite effects, and it improves type safety and error handling in the interpreter.

## Verification
We have verified that the `toEffect` function in `Interpreter.hs` correctly implements the conversion of composite effects:

```haskell
toEffect :: CoreEffect -> CE.Effect
toEffect = \case
  DepositEff (TELDepositEffect rid amt pid) -> CE.DepositEffect rid amt pid
  WithdrawEff (TELWithdrawEffect rid amt pid) -> CE.WithdrawEffect rid amt pid
  TransferEff (TELTransferEffect rid spid dpid amt) -> CE.TransferEffect rid amt spid dpid
  ObserveEff (TELObserveEffect tid fact) -> CE.TimelineEffect tid fact
  EmitEff (TELEmitEffect event) -> CE.ProgramEffect (ProgramId "self") event
  InvokeEff (TELInvokeEffect program) -> CE.ProgramEffect (ProgramId "invoke") program
  SequenceEff e1 e2 -> CE.CompositeEffect [toEffect e1, toEffect e2]
  ParallelEff e1 e2 -> CE.CompositeEffect [toEffect e1, toEffect e2]
  ChoiceEff e1 e2 -> CE.CompositeEffect [toEffect e1, toEffect e2]
```

## Improvements Made

### Type Safety Improvements
- Updated `VClosure` constructor to accept a list of `Identifier`s, fixing type mismatch errors
- Fixed the `LambdaExpr` handler to properly bind arguments to parameters
- Made `applyFunction` safer by using `viaNonEmpty` instead of unsafe `head`
- Updated `VFunction` to use a polymorphic effect type for better compatibility
- Fixed string concatenation errors by properly converting between String and Text

### Testing
We created a standalone test to verify that:
- `SequenceEff` correctly converts to a `CompositeEffect` with elements in the correct order
- `ParallelEff` correctly converts to a `CompositeEffect` with both effects
- `ChoiceEff` correctly converts to a `CompositeEffect` with both effects

All tests pass, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

## Known Issues and Future Work
See the `INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` file for a detailed list of remaining issues and future work items. The most important ones are:

1. Fix operator pattern matching in `applyOperator`
2. Add proper effect constraints to functions that use `incrementTime`
3. Address hash type conversion issues in mock implementations

## Reviewer Notes
When reviewing this PR, please focus on:
1. Confirming that `toEffect` correctly handles composite effects
2. Verifying that the type safety improvements are correct and maintain the intended behavior
3. Ensuring that the test cases adequately cover the functionality being verified

The integration issues documented in `INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` will be addressed in follow-up PRs.
