## Integration with Content-Addressable Code System

### Hashing Approach

1. **Function-Level Hashing**: Each function will be hashed individually
2. **Canonical Representation**: AST nodes will be serialized in a canonical form
3. **Dependency Inclusion**: Hashes will not include dependencies
4. **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256 will be used for consistency with the existing system

### Name Registration

1. **Name→Hash Mapping**: Names will be stored as metadata pointing to content hashes
2. **Multiple Names**: A single hash can have multiple names
3. **Name Resolution**: Latest name registration will be preferred for execution

### Versioning Strategy

1. **Immutable Definitions**: Once stored, definitions cannot be modified
2. **Version Tracking**: Metadata will track creation time and author
3. **Dependency Pinning**: References will use exact hashes for stability
