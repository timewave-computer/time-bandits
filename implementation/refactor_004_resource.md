# Refactor 004: Resource Concurrency and Account Programs

### 1. Separate Core Types from Logic
- [x] Move all **pure types** into `Core/` (Effect, Resource, Timeline, TimeMap, Program, Actor, etc.).
- [x] Ensure no application logic, precondition checks, or interpreter logic lives in `Core/`.
- [x] Move all logic into `Execution/`, `Preconditions/`, or `Adapters/`.

---

### 2. Clarify Effect Application Pipeline
- [x] Split `EffectInterpreter` into:
    - `EffectInterpreter` - core effect application logic.
    - `EffectLogger` - responsible for appending to logs.
    - `PreconditionEvaluator` - responsible for evaluating all effect preconditions.

- [x] Ensure all effect application flows through `EffectInterpreter`, not scattered across modules.

---

### 3. Fix Program State Representation
- [x] Split `Program` into:
    - `ProgramDefinition` (static metadata & initial state).
    - `ProgramState` (mutable memory + causal pointers).

- [x] Ensure every modification to program state passes through the effect interpreter pipeline.

---

### 4. Simplify Simulation Control
- [x] Move simulation management into `Simulation/Controller.hs`.
- [x] `Main.hs` should only parse CLI args and invoke controller functions.

---

### 5. Centralize Messaging
- [x] Consolidate all traveler/keeper/bandit messaging into `Messaging.hs`.
- [x] Ensure messages are only **wrappers around effects** — not separate types.

---

### 6. Timeline Adapters
- [x] Make each timeline implement a `TimelineAdapter` interface.
- [x] Ensure all RPC, proof fetching, and balance queries are centralized in these adapters.

---

### 7. Consistent Time Map Handling
- [x] Every `ProposedEffect` must carry:
    - Observed Time Map.
    - Declared read/write set.

---

### 8. Unified Logging
- [x] All applied effects must go through `EffectLogger`, writing to **per-resource logs**.
- [x] There should be **no direct file or log writes outside this logger**.

---

## Adding Resource Concurrency & Account Program Primitives

This section defines a **detailed plan** to introduce:

- Per-resource concurrency.
- Account programs as first-class actor gateways.

---

### Phase 1: New Core Types

- [x] Add `ActorId` type:
```haskell
newtype ActorId = ActorId Text
```

- [x] Define `AccountProgram`:
```haskell
data AccountProgram = AccountProgram
    { owner :: ActorId
    , balances :: Map ResourceId Integer
    , inbox :: [ReceivedMessage]
    , outbox :: [SentMessage]
    , timelineAccounts :: Map TimelineId Address
    }
```

- [x] Add `ResourceLedger`:
```haskell
type ResourceLedger = Map ResourceId (ProgramId, ResourceState)
```

- [x] Add `LockTable` for per-resource locking:
```haskell
type LockTable = Map ResourceId LockStatus

data LockStatus
    = Unlocked
    | LockedBy EffectId
```

- [x] Modify `ExecutionLog` to be:
```haskell
type ExecutionLog = Map ResourceId [LogEntry]
```

- [x] Update `LogEntry`:
```haskell
data LogEntry = LogEntry
    { effect :: Effect
    , parentHash :: Maybe Hash
    , timeMapHash :: Hash
    , resultingStateHash :: Hash
    , zkProof :: Maybe Proof
    }
```

---

### Phase 2: Effect Interpreter Refactor

- [x] Modify `EffectInterpreter` to:
    - Lock only the **write set** of each effect.
    - Check observed time map consistency.
    - Evaluate preconditions.
    - Apply effect to either:
        - Resource ledger (resource transfer effects).
        - Program memory (internal state effects).
    - Append to per-resource logs.
    - Release locks.

---

### Phase 3: Introduce Account Programs as Mandatory Gateway

- [x] Define `AccountMessage` type:
```haskell
data AccountMessage
    = Deposit { resource :: ResourceId, amount :: Integer, to :: ProgramId }
    | Withdraw { resource :: ResourceId, amount :: Integer, from :: ProgramId }
    | Invoke { targetProgram :: ProgramId, entrypoint :: String, arguments :: [Value] }
    | ReceiveCallback { fromProgram :: ProgramId, payload :: Value }
    | CustomMessage { messageType :: Text, payload :: Value }
```

- [x] Ensure every traveler message results in:
```haskell
ProposedEffect
    { effect = AccountMessageEffect actorId message
    , observedTimeMap = currentTimeMap
    }
```

- [x] Add `applyAccountMessage` to the interpreter:
    - Applies deposits, withdrawals, calls, and callbacks to the account program's state.
    - Updates the account program's balances, inbox, and outbox.
    - Applies internal transfers as ledger updates.

---

### Phase 4: Precondition Handling Update

- [x] Consolidate all precondition checks into:
```haskell
checkPreconditions :: ProposedEffect -> ResourceLedger -> TimeMap -> Bool
```

- [x] Ensure preconditions check:
    - Ownership in `ResourceLedger`.
    - Consistency of external facts (balances, proofs) against observed time map.

---

### Phase 5: Program Messaging Rework

- [x] All program-to-program messages must flow through account programs.
- [x] Add:
```haskell
sendMessage :: ProgramId -> AccountMessage -> IO ()
receiveCallback :: ProgramId -> Value -> IO ()
```
- [x] Remove any remaining direct actor communication.

---

### Phase 6: Time Map Validation on Apply

- [x] Every applied effect must:
    - Compare observed vs current time map.
    - If the time map advanced, re-validate all preconditions.
    - Reject effects if external facts changed in an incompatible way.

---

### Phase 7: Simulation Integration

- [x] Ensure all simulation scenarios:
    - Create account programs for every actor.
    - Route all traveler messages through account programs.
- [x] Modify `Scenario.hs`:
```haskell
data ActorSpec = ActorSpec
    { actorId :: ActorId
    , initialBalances :: Map ResourceId Integer
    }
```

---

### Phase 8: Tests

- [x] Create unit tests for account creation and operations
- [x] Test resource locking and unlocking
- [x] Validate balance tracking functions
- [x] Develop property tests for concurrent effect application
- [x] Test time map consistency properties
- [x] Verify resource ownership invariants
- [x] Create simulation scenarios for cross-chain operations
- [x] Test account program interactions
- [x] Validate end-to-end workflows
