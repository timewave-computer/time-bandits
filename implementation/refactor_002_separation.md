# Refactor 002: Separation of Concerns

## Status

Completed
Includes:

- Program-based execution with explicit resource ownership
- Causal ordering via Lamport clocks and time maps
- Invocation model with safe resource passing
- Multi-mode simulation (in-memory, local, geo-distributed)
- Nix flakes for per-actor builds & simulation controller

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Type Abstractions & Separation of Concerns

**Goal**: Establish clear Timeline, Resource, Program, Effect separation.

### ✅ Step 1.1 Introduce Timeline, Resource, Program, and Effect as First-Class Types

- ✅ Move timeline interactions into `Timeline.hs`
- ✅ Define resources as first-class entities in `Resource.hs`
- ✅ Define program state and memory in `Program.hs`
- ✅ Define effects as explicit operations in `Effect.hs`g

Example Type Structure:

```haskell
data Timeline = Timeline 
    { timelineId :: TimelineId 
    , eventLog :: [Event] 
    , clock :: TimelineClock 
    }

data Resource 
    = TokenBalanceResource TokenId Address Amount 
    | EscrowReceiptResource EscrowId 
    | ContractWitnessResource ContractId Value 
    | SyntheticInternalMarker Text

data Program = Program 
    { programId :: ProgramId 
    , executionState :: ProgramState 
    , memory :: ProgramMemory 
    }

data Effect 
    = EscrowToProgram Resource ProgramId MemorySlot 
    | InvokeProgram ProgramId FunctionName [Resource] 
    | ClaimFromProgram ProgramId MemorySlot Resource 
    | DelegateCapability Capability ProgramId Expiry 
    | WatchResource ResourceKey Condition Trigger 
    | AtomicBatch [Effect]
```

### ✅ Step 1.2 Replace Implicit State Updates with Explicit Effect Execution

- ✅ All timeline changes should now happen via Effect application.
- ✅ No more direct state modification—everything must go through an effect handler.
- ✅ Implement initial effect execution pipeline in `EffectExecutor.hs`:

```haskell
applyEffect :: ProgramState -> Effect -> Either ExecutionError ProgramState
applyEffect state (EscrowToProgram res pid slot) = modifyMemory pid slot (Just res) state
applyEffect state (InvokeProgram pid fn args) = executeProgram pid fn args state
applyEffect state (ClaimFromProgram pid slot res) = claimResource pid slot res state
```

### ✅ Step 1.3 Cleanup After Phase 1

After implementing the new modules, clean up existing code to avoid duplication:

**Resource Module Cleanup**:
- ✅ Identify `ResourceOps` effect in `TimeBandits.Effects` and related operations
- ✅ Mark as deprecated with comments directing to `TimeBandits.Resource`
- ✅ Create adapter functions in `Resource.hs` for backward compatibility

**Program Module Cleanup**:
- ✅ Identify program-related types and functions in `TimeBandits.Core` and `TimeBandits.Effects`
- ✅ Mark as deprecated with comments directing to `TimeBandits.Program` and `TimeBandits.ProgramEffect`
- ✅ Create adapter functions in the new modules for backward compatibility

**Timeline Module Cleanup**:
- ✅ Identify timeline-related types and functions in `TimeBandits.Core` and `TimeBandits.Effects`
- ✅ Mark as deprecated with comments directing to `TimeBandits.Timeline`
- ✅ Create adapter functions in `Timeline.hs` for backward compatibility

**General Approach**:
- ✅ Do not remove any code yet, only mark as deprecated
- ✅ Update imports gradually as other modules are refactored
- ✅ Ensure tests pass with the new implementations

## ✅ Phase 2: Implement Program Invocation & Resource Ownership Model

**Goal**: Enable programs to own and transfer resources explicitly.

### ✅ Step 2.1 Implement EscrowToProgram & ClaimFromProgram

- ✅ Introduce escrow memory slots inside `ProgramMemory.hs`.
- ✅ Programs lose ownership of resources when escrowing them.
- ✅ Only the target program can claim escrowed resources.

Example in `ProgramMemory.hs`:

```haskell
data MemorySlot = MemorySlot Text

data ProgramMemory = ProgramMemory 
    { slots :: Map MemorySlot Resource }

escrowToProgram :: ProgramMemory -> MemorySlot -> Resource -> ProgramMemory
escrowToProgram mem slot res = mem { slots = insert slot res (slots mem) }

claimFromProgram :: ProgramMemory -> MemorySlot -> Maybe (Resource, ProgramMemory)
claimFromProgram mem slot = do
    res <- lookup slot (slots mem)
    let newMem = mem { slots = delete slot (slots mem) }
    return (res, newMem)
```

### ✅ Step 2.2 Implement InvokeProgram for Cross-Program Calls

- ✅ Implement function call execution between programs.
- ✅ Programs should declare entry points and allow safe invocation.

Example in `InvokeProgram.hs`:

```haskell
invokeProgram :: ProgramId -> FunctionName -> [Resource] -> Either ExecutionError ProgramState
invokeProgram pid fn args = do
    program <- lookupProgram pid
    case lookupFunction fn program of
        Just f -> f args
        Nothing -> Left FunctionNotFound
```

### ✅ Step 2.3 Cleanup After Phase 2

After implementing the program invocation and resource ownership model:

**Program Module Finalization**:
- ✅ Update any remaining code using the old program invocation patterns
- ✅ Convert direct program state updates to use explicit effect execution
- ✅ Complete adapter functions in `Program.hs` and `ProgramEffect.hs`

**Resource Ownership Cleanup**:
- ✅ Identify and update code that manipulates resources directly
- ✅ Ensure all resource transfers go through the escrow mechanism
- ✅ Update tests to use the new escrow/claim pattern

## ✅ Phase 3: Implement Time Maps & Transition Messages

**Goal**: Ensure programs execute in causal order across timelines with proper authorization and proof.

### ✅ Step 3.1 Implement Time Maps for Cross-Timeline Consistency

- ✅ Maintain a snapshot of multiple timelines with their latest state
- ✅ Track Lamport clocks for logical time ordering
- ✅ Ensure programs always observe strictly advancing time maps

```haskell
data TimeMap = TimeMap 
    { timelines :: Map TimelineId LamportClock
    , observedHeads :: Map TimelineId BlockHeader 
    , observedTimestamps :: Map TimelineId UTCTime
    }
```

### ✅ Step 3.2 Implement TransitionMessage for Program Execution

- ✅ All program transitions must be triggered by a TransitionMessage
- ✅ Messages include proof of resource control and guard validation
- ✅ Each message links to its causal parent (previous effect)

```haskell
data TransitionMessage = TransitionMessage 
    { programId :: ProgramId 
    , stepIndex :: Int 
    , parentEffectHash :: Hash 
    , proof :: ZKProof  -- For validating guard conditions
    , resources :: [Resource]  -- Resources being used
    }
```

### ✅ Step 3.3 Implement Execution Log for Applied Effects

- ✅ Every applied effect produces a log entry for auditability
- ✅ Log entries are content-addressed and causally linked
- ✅ The execution log is fully replayable

```haskell
data LogEntry = LogEntry 
    { effect :: Effect 
    , appliedAt :: UTCTime 
    , causalParent :: Hash 
    , resultingStateHash :: Hash 
    }
```

### ✅ Step 3.4 Cleanup After Phase 3

After implementing all modules:

**TimeMap Integration**:
- ✅ Migrate existing timeline logic to use the new TimeMap implementation
- ✅ Update any code that relies on timeline-specific time ordering
- ✅ Ensure all cross-timeline operations respect causal ordering

**Transition-Based Execution**:
- ✅ Replace direct effect execution with TransitionMessage validation
- ✅ Update the EffectExecutor to verify proofs and resource ownership
- ✅ Update tests to use transition messages for program advancement

## ✅ Phase 4: Implement Controller & Multi-Mode Simulation

**Goal**: Support different deployment modes with consistent controller behavior and clearly defined actor roles.

### ✅ Step 4.1 Implement Controller (Controller.hs)

- ✅ Enforces system contract regardless of deployment mode
- ✅ Handles transition message validation, effect application, and time map updates
- ✅ Maintains the append-only execution log
- ✅ Coordinates between Time Travelers, Time Keepers, and Time Bandits

```haskell
data Controller = Controller 
    { mode :: SimulationMode
    , timeMap :: TimeMap
    , executionLog :: [LogEntry]
    }

data SimulationMode = InMemory | LocalProcesses | GeoDistributed

runController :: Controller -> TransitionMessage -> IO (Either ExecutionError (Controller, ProgramState))
runController controller msg = do
    -- Validate message (signature, proof, resources)
    -- Coordinate with Time Keepers to validate against timeline rules
    -- Utilize Time Bandits to apply effect and generate proofs
    -- Update program state
    -- Update time map and append to execution log
    pure $ Right (updatedController, newProgramState)
```

### ✅ Step 4.2 Implement Actor Abstraction for Different Modes

- ✅ Define the three key actor roles: Time Travelers, Time Keepers, and Time Bandits
- ✅ All actors implement the same interface, regardless of deployment mode
- ✅ In-memory: Actors are Haskell functions in the same process
- ✅ Local multi-process: Actors run in separate processes with Unix socket messaging
- ✅ Geo-distributed: Actors run on remote machines with TCP/RPC messaging

```haskell
-- Base actor with common properties
class Actor a where
    runActor :: a -> IO ()
    actorId :: a -> ActorID
    sendMessage :: a -> TransitionMessage -> IO ()
    receiveMessage :: a -> IO (Maybe TransitionMessage)

-- Specialized actor types
data TimeTraveler = TimeTraveler
    { travelerId :: ActorID
    , capabilities :: [Capability]
    , ownedResources :: [ResourceID]
    , programAccess :: [ProgramID]
    }

data TimeKeeper = TimeKeeper
    { keeperId :: ActorID
    , managedTimelines :: [TimelineID]
    , validationRules :: [ValidationRule]
    , timelineStates :: Map TimelineID TimelineState
    }

data TimeBandit = TimeBandit
    { banditId :: ActorID
    , networkRole :: NetworkRole
    , connectedPeers :: [PeerID]
    , proofGenerators :: [ProofGenerator]
    , executedPrograms :: Map ProgramID ExecutionState
    }
```

### ✅ Step 4.3 Implement Deployment for Different Modes

- ✅ In-memory: Direct function calls with in-memory queues
- ✅ Local multi-process: Spawn processes with Nix and communicate via Unix sockets
- ✅ Geo-distributed: Remote execution via SSH with TCP or external RPC
- ✅ Each deployment mode must support all three actor roles

```haskell
deployActor :: SimulationMode -> ActorSpec -> IO ActorHandle
deployActor InMemory spec = deployInMemoryActor spec
deployActor LocalProcesses spec = deployLocalActor spec
deployActor GeoDistributed spec = deployRemoteActor spec

-- Deploy specific actor types
deployTimeTraveler :: SimulationMode -> TimeTravelerSpec -> IO TimeTravelerHandle
deployTimeKeeper :: SimulationMode -> TimeKeeperSpec -> IO TimeKeeperHandle
deployTimeBandit :: SimulationMode -> TimeBanditSpec -> IO TimeBanditHandle
```

### ✅ Step 4.4 Implement Scenario Definition with TOML

- ✅ Define actors, their roles, and initial program deployments
- ✅ Specify the simulation mode
- ✅ Configure communication channels and deployment targets
- ✅ Support all three actor roles in scenario definitions

```TOML
-- Example TOML structure for scenario definition
-- [scenario]
-- name = "Cross-Timeline Resource Transfer"
-- mode = "LocalProcesses"
--
-- [[time_travelers]]
-- id = "alice"
-- capabilities = ["ResourceCreation", "ResourceTransfer"]
--
-- [[time_keepers]]
-- id = "ethereum_keeper"
-- timelines = ["ethereum_main"]
--
-- [[time_bandits]]
-- id = "network_node_1"
-- roles = ["ProofGeneration", "NetworkCoordination"]
```

```haskell
loadScenario :: FilePath -> IO Scenario
loadScenario path = do
    toml <- readFile path
    parseScenario toml
```

### ✅ Step 4.5 Cleanup After Phase 4

After implementing the controller and multi-mode simulation:

**Controller Integration**:
- ✅ Update any code that directly applies effects to use the controller
- ✅ Ensure all program execution happens through TransitionMessages
- ✅ Update tests to verify controller behavior in different modes

**Actor Implementation Cleanup**:
- ✅ Migrate any actor-specific code to use the common abstraction
- ✅ Ensure proper separation of concerns between Time Travelers, Time Keepers, and Time Bandits
- ✅ Update deployment scripts to work with the new modes
- ✅ Ensure backwards compatibility during the transition

## ✅ Phase 5: Implement Security & Invariant Checks

**Goal**: Enforce the system contract's security properties and invariants.

### ✅ Step 5.1 Implement Ownership Verification

- ✅ Ensure each resource has exactly one owner at any time
- ✅ Enforce that only authorized programs can access resources
- ✅ Verify ownership transfer through proper escrow and claim operations

```haskell
verifyOwnership :: Resource -> Address -> Either SecurityError ()
verifyOwnership res addr =
    if resourceOwner res == addr
        then Right ()
        else Left $ OwnershipVerificationFailed res addr
```

### ✅ Step 5.2 Implement Causal Order Verification

- ✅ Ensure time maps always advance monotonically
- ✅ Verify that cross-timeline events respect logical clock ordering
- ✅ Prevent backdated transitions with stale time maps

```haskell
verifyCausalOrder :: TimeMap -> TimeMap -> Either SecurityError ()
verifyCausalOrder oldMap newMap =
    if allTimelinesCausallyAdvanced oldMap newMap
        then Right ()
        else Left CausalOrderViolation
```

### ✅ Step 5.3 Implement ZK Proof Generation and Verification

- ✅ Generate zero-knowledge proofs for guard conditions
- ✅ Verify proofs before applying effects
- ✅ Ensure all transitions carry valid proofs

```haskell
generateProof :: Guard -> Resource -> IO ZKProof
generateProof guard res = -- Implementation depends on specific ZK system

verifyProof :: ZKProof -> Guard -> Resource -> IO Bool
verifyProof proof guard res = -- Implementation depends on specific ZK system
```

### ✅ Step 5.4 Implement System-Level Security Properties

- ✅ Double-spend prevention through single-owner rule
- ✅ Reentrancy prevention through Lamport clocks
- ✅ Traceability through complete audit trail
- ✅ Prevention of backdated transitions

```haskell
data SecurityProperty
    = NoDoubleSpend
    | NoReentrancy
    | FullTraceability
    | NoBackdating

verifySecurityProperty :: SecurityProperty -> ExecutionLog -> ResourceLedger -> TimeMap -> Either SecurityError ()
verifySecurityProperty NoDoubleSpend log ledger _ = verifyNoDoubleSpend log ledger
verifySecurityProperty NoReentrancy log _ _ = verifyNoReentrancy log
verifySecurityProperty FullTraceability log _ _ = verifyFullTraceability log
verifySecurityProperty NoBackdating log _ timeMap = verifyNoBackdating log timeMap
```

### ✅ Step 5.5 Final Cleanup

After implementing all security and invariant checks:

**Complete Deprecated Code Removal**:
- ✅ Remove all code previously marked as deprecated
- ✅ Ensure all modules use the new abstractions and patterns
- ✅ Verify that no implicit state updates remain in the codebase

**Documentation Update**:
- ✅ Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture
- ✅ Create migration guides for any external users of the codebase
- ✅ Document the security guarantees and how they're enforced

## ✅ Phase 6: Implement Distributed Execution

This phase focuses on implementing the distributed execution capabilities of the Time Bandits system, allowing it to run across multiple processes and machines.

### ✅ Step 6.1: Define Simulation Modes

- ✅ In-memory: Direct function calls with in-memory queues
- ✅ Local multi-process: Spawn processes with Nix and communicate via Unix sockets

- ✅ Each deployment mode must support all three actor roles

### ✅ Step 6.2: Implement Local Multi-Process Mode

- ✅ Local multi-process configuration
- ✅ Process management
- ✅ Inter-process communication

### ✅ Step 6.3: Implement Geo-Distributed Mode

This step involves implementing the geo-distributed mode, which allows the Time Bandits system to run across multiple machines in different geographic locations. This mode requires:

- TCP/IP communication between nodes
- Encryption of all communications
- Peer discovery and connection management
- Handling of network partitions and reconnections

**Implementation Progress:**
- ✅ Created QUIC-based networking implementation in `NetworkQUIC.hs`
- ✅ Integrated QUIC networking with existing P2P infrastructure
- ✅ Added certificate generation for secure communications
- ✅ Updated Main.hs to support QUIC-based geo-distributed mode
- ✅ Implementing peer discovery and connection management
- ✅ Handling network partitions and reconnections
- ✅ Testing geo-distributed mode with multiple machines

### ✅ Step 6.4 Implement Distributed Execution Log

This step involves implementing a distributed execution log that can be used to store and replicate execution logs across multiple nodes in the network. This is essential for the geo-distributed mode to ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of the system state.

**Implementation Progress:**
- ✅ Created `DistributedLog.hs` module with core functionality
- ✅ Implemented log persistence to disk
- ✅ Added log replication capabilities
- ✅ Integrated with QUIC-based networking
- ✅ Implemented conflict resolution

- ✅ Testing distributed log with multiple nodes

## ✅ Phase 7: Implement Timeline Descriptors & Adapters

This phase focuses on formalizing timeline interactions through descriptors and adapters, making the system more flexible and adaptable to different blockchains.

### ✅ Step 7.1 Implement Timeline Descriptors

Create a formal system for describing different timeline types (blockchains, rollups, event logs) with their specific properties and interfaces.

```haskell
-- | Timeline descriptor defining a timeline's properties
data TimelineDescriptor = TimelineDescriptor
  { tdId :: TimelineHash              -- ^ Unique timeline identifier
  , tdName :: ByteString              -- ^ Human-readable name
  , tdVmType :: VMType                -- ^ Virtual machine type
  , tdClockType :: ClockType          -- ^ Clock type
  , tdEndpoint :: EndpointConfig      -- ^ RPC endpoint configuration
  , tdEffectMappings :: Map EffectType EffectHandlerSpec  -- ^ Effect to handler mappings
  , tdMetadata :: Map ByteString ByteString  -- ^ Additional metadata
  }

-- | Virtual Machine types supported by timelines
data VMType
  = EVM        -- ^ Ethereum Virtual Machine
  | CosmWasm   -- ^ CosmWasm (Cosmos ecosystem)
  | MoveVM     -- ^ Move VM (Sui, Aptos)
  | Solana     -- ^ Solana Programs
  | Native     -- ^ Native Haskell implementation (off-chain)
  | MockVM     -- ^ Mock VM for testing

-- | Clock types for different timelines
data ClockType
  = BlockHeight   -- ^ Block number/height based
  | SlotNumber    -- ^ Slot number based
  | Timestamp     -- ^ Timestamp based
  | LamportClock  -- ^ Logical Lamport clock
```

### ✅ Step 7.2 Implement Timeline Adapters

Create adapters for different timeline types that provide a uniform interface while handling blockchain-specific implementation details.

```haskell
-- | Timeline adapter for interacting with a specific timeline
data TimelineAdapter = TimelineAdapter
  { taConfig :: AdapterConfig              -- ^ Adapter configuration
  , taState :: AdapterState                -- ^ Adapter state
  , taExecuteEffect :: Effect -> IO (Either AdapterError ByteString)  -- ^ Function to execute effects
  , taQueryState :: ByteString -> IO (Either AdapterError ByteString)  -- ^ Function to query state
  , taGetLatestHead :: IO (Either AdapterError BlockHeader)  -- ^ Function to get latest head
  }

-- | Create a timeline adapter from a descriptor
createAdapter :: 
  TimelineDescriptor -> 
  Maybe Manager -> 
  IO TimelineAdapter

-- | Execute an effect using the appropriate adapter
executeEffect :: 
  TimelineAdapter -> 
  Effect -> 
  IO ByteString
```

### ✅ Step 7.3 Implement TOML-based Configuration

- ✅ Create a TOML parser for timeline descriptors
- ✅ Support loading and validating descriptor files
- ✅ Generate adapters from descriptor files

```haskell
-- | Load a timeline descriptor from a TOML file
loadDescriptor :: FilePath -> IO (Either Error TimelineDescriptor)

-- | Parse a timeline descriptor from ByteString (TOML content)
parseDescriptor :: ByteString -> Either Error TimelineDescriptor

-- | Validate a timeline descriptor
validateDescriptor :: TimelineDescriptor -> Either Error Bool
```

### ✅ Step 7.4 Integrate Adapters with Effect Interpreter

- ✅ Modify the effect interpreter to use timeline adapters
- ✅ Route effects to appropriate adapters based on timeline
- ✅ Handle adapter errors and retries

```haskell
-- | Apply an effect using the appropriate timeline adapter
applyEffectWithAdapter ::
  Effect ->
  Map TimelineHash TimelineAdapter ->
  TimeMap ->
  IO (Either Error EffectResult)
```

### ✅ Step 7.5 Implement Example Timeline Descriptors

- ✅ Create example descriptors for common blockchains:
  - Ethereum Mainnet
  - Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
  - Solana Mainnet
  - Cosmos Hub
  - Local mock timelines

```toml
# Example Ethereum timeline descriptor
[timeline]
id = "ethereum-mainnet"
name = "Ethereum Mainnet"
vm_type = "EVM"
clock_type = "BlockHeight"

[endpoint]
primary = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY"
backups = ["https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"]
```

# Addendum III: Clarification on Effect Handling and Pluggability (2025-03-07)

## Background

As the refactor progresses, we need to establish clear and enforceable guidance around how **effects** are handled, how they flow through the system, and what level of customization (if any) is available to **time travelers** when defining their programs.

This addendum formalizes the following principles, which should guide the next stages of the refactor.

## 1. Unified Effect Pipeline

All effects must be processed through a **single, unified effect interpreter** that handles the full lifecycle of each effect. This interpreter owns:

- Fetching the latest time map.
- Fetching program memory.
- Evaluating preconditions.
- Applying state changes.
- Updating the time map (if the effect requires it).
- Appending a structured log entry.
- Producing any required proofs.

This ensures that **every effect application follows the same invariant-enforcing pipeline**.

## 2. Fixed Set of Canonical Effects

At this stage, the **set of supported effect types** is fixed at the protocol level. Time travelers can only compose programs using these pre-defined effect types:

- EscrowToProgram
- ClaimFromProgram
- InvokeProgram
- WatchResource
- DelegateCapability
- InternalStateUpdate

Each effect has a **well-defined schema** and **precondition set**, and the interpreter knows how to process all supported effect types directly.


## 3. Programs Are Declarative, Not Executable Code

Time travelers **do not write effect handler code**. Instead, programs are defined declaratively as sequences of these pre-defined effects.  
Effects are **pure data** — a program definition is just a structured list of effect declarations, along with their parameters and guards.

This ensures programs are:
- Portable across simulation and deployment modes.
- Replayable from first principles.
- Auditable by anyone using only the execution log.


## 4. Timeline Adapters Are Pluggable

The part of the system that **interacts with external timelines** (e.g., calling contracts, reading balances, fetching proofs) is the **timeline adapter** layer.  
Each timeline has a corresponding **timeline descriptor**, and the interpreter calls the adapter for external effects (like escrow or claims).  
Adapters are **per timeline**, not per program. This keeps programs timeline-agnostic while allowing the system to support multiple VMs (EVM, WASM, UTXO).


## 5. Effect Set Can Only Be Extended via Protocol Upgrades

New effect types can only be added through a **formal protocol upgrade** to Time Bandits itself. Time travelers cannot introduce arbitrary new effect types when defining their programs.  
This ensures all effects follow the same safety, replayability, and proof requirements, enforced directly by the interpreter.


## 6. Precondition Evaluation is Centralized

Each effect type has a **formal precondition schema** that defines what must be true in the program's memory and time map for the effect to apply.  
This logic will live in a **central precondition evaluator**, not in individual effect handlers.  
This makes precondition checks:
- Uniform across effects.
- Easy to audit and modify.
- Testable in isolation.


## 7. Ownership Invariant is Enforced Globally

The interpreter maintains a **ResourceLedger** that tracks who owns each resource at all times.  
All transfers go through this ledger, ensuring:
- Every resource has exactly one owner.
- Double-spends and unauthorized access are impossible.
- Ownership changes appear directly in the execution log.


## Summary of Allowed Pluggability

| Layer                       | Pluggable?            | Who Controls It |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Effect Types            | No (fixed set)    | Time Bandits Protocol |
| Effect Parameters  | Yes                       | Time Travelers (per program) |
| Effect Sequences | Yes                       | Time Travelers (per program) |
| Timeline Adapters | Yes                       | Time Bandits Core (per timeline) |
| Proof Systems         | Yes                       | Time Bandits Core (per effect type) |


## Immediate Refactor Implications

- Introduce `EffectInterpreter.hs` as the **sole entry point for effect processing**.
- Move all precondition checks into a central `PreconditionEvaluator.hs`.
- Introduce `ResourceLedger.hs` to enforce global ownership.
- Make all external calls flow through `TimelineAdapter` instances.
- Remove any direct mutation of program memory from effect-specific code — all state changes happen inside the interpreter.


## Reasoning

This approach ensures:
- Consistent handling of causal consistency, time maps, and ownership.
- Programs are **pure data** and fully declarative.
- Effects are portable across timelines and simulation modes.
- All state changes are covered by the same proofs and log entries.
- Adding new timelines requires only **new adapters**, not changes to programs.
- Adding new effects requires a **protocol upgrade**, preserving system safety.


## Long-Term Extensibility Plan (Optional Future Work)

In a future phase, Time Bandits could add an **effect registry** that allows registering new effect types via governance.  
Each new effect type would need:
- A formal schema.
- A defined precondition set.
- A proof generator.
- A log format.

This allows controlled extensibility **while preserving replayability**. For now, this is explicitly out of scope for the current refactor.
