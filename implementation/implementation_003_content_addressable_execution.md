## Final Notes

The implementation should prioritize:

2. **Security** - Enforce strict resource limits and effect permissions
3. **Performance** - Optimize for common execution patterns
4. **Developer Experience** - Make debugging and tracing intuitive

The type class approach for resource allocation will allow us to evolve from the initial static allocator to more sophisticated strategies without disrupting the architecture.
