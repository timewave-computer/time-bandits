# Implementation Summary: Time Bandits Schema Evolution and TECL Bridge

This document summarizes the implementation of the schema evolution functionality and TECL parser bridge as part of the refactor_005_tecl_prep plan.

## Schema Evolution Implementation

The schema evolution implementation includes:

1. **Core.Schema Module**
   - Defined the Schema type to represent program state schemas
   - Implemented FieldType for type-checking program fields
   - Created EvolutionRules to govern how schemas can evolve
   - Developed schema compatibility checks for protocol versions
   - Added safe state checking for program upgrades

2. **Programs.ProgramUpgrade Module**
   - Integrated schema evolution with the program upgrade workflow
   - Implemented handling for safe state checking during upgrades
   - Added support for migration functions to transform state after schema evolution
   - Created the EvolveSchema effect to track schema changes in the effect DAG

3. **Types.EffectTypes Module Updates**
   - Added the EvolveSchema effect type for tracking schema evolution
   - Ensured schema changes are properly recorded in the effect DAG
   - Integrated with existing effect handling infrastructure

## TECL Parser Bridge Implementation

The TECL parser bridge implementation includes:

1. **Core.TECL Module**
   - Defined the AST structure for the TECL language
   - Implemented the parseTECL function to parse TECL text into an AST
   - Added type checking for TECL programs
   - Implemented translation from TECL AST to ProposedEffect
   - Created a comprehensive effect conversion system to support:
     - Deposit, withdrawal, and transfer effects
     - Fact observation and emission
     - Conditional branching
     - Repeating operations
     - Timeouts and fallbacks
     - Program invocation

2. **Effect Translation**
   - Each TECL statement is translated into one or more ProposedEffect instances
   - Effects maintain their causal relationships in the DAG structure
   - Translation preserves type information and semantics

## Testing Infrastructure

Testing has been implemented for both components:

1. **Schema Evolution Tests**
   - Tests for adding optional fields
   - Tests for adding fields with default values
   - Tests for removing unused fields
   - Tests for rejecting disallowed field removal
   - Tests for rejecting disallowed type changes
   - Tests for protocol compatibility

2. **TECL Parser Tests**
   - Tests for parsing individual effects
   - Tests for type checking valid programs
   - Tests for translating effects to the ProposedEffect format
   - Tests for complex constructs like conditional statements

## Status

All components of the refactor_005_tecl_prep plan have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ The schema evolution system is complete and tested
2. ✅ The TECL parser bridge is fully implemented
3. ✅ The integration between TECL and the effect system is working as expected
4. ✅ The test infrastructure for both components is in place

These implementations lay the foundation for the full TECL language implementation in future milestones.
