# TEL Integration Status

## Fixed Issues

1. **Confirm `toEffect` Uses `CompositeEffect`**
   - ✅ Verified that `toEffect` correctly handles `SequenceEff`, `ParallelEff`, and `ChoiceEff` by converting them to `CompositeEffect`
   - ✅ Created and ran tests to verify this functionality

2. **Type Safety Improvements**
   - ✅ Updated `VClosure` constructor to accept a list of `Identifier`s instead of a single one
   - ✅ Fixed the `LambdaExpr` handler to properly bind arguments to parameters
   - ✅ Made `applyFunction` safer by using `viaNonEmpty` instead of `head`
   - ✅ Updated `VFunction` to use a polymorphic effect type that can be used with any effect row
   - ✅ Fixed string concatenation error by properly converting between String and Text

## Remaining Issues

1. **Operator Pattern Matching**
   - The `applyOperator` function has type errors with string literals being used for pattern matching against the `Operator` type
   - This suggests the `Operator` type may not implement `IsString`

2. **Clock/Time Management**
   - The `incrementTime` function is called in `sequenceEffects` but requires `LogicalClock` effect which is not in the context
   - Need to add this effect to the function's constraints

3. **ResourceInfo and Hash Type Issues**
   - String literals are being used where specific hash types are expected in the mock implementation
   - These types need proper string conversion functions or constructors

## Next Steps

1. Continue fixing the remaining linter errors one by one, focusing on the most critical ones first
2. Add proper effect constraints to functions that need them
3. Ensure all string/text conversions are properly handled
4. Consider refactoring the mock implementations to use proper hash types

## Test Results

All tests for the `toEffect` function pass, confirming that it correctly converts composite effects to `CompositeEffect`.
