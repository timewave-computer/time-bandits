# Refactor 101: Content-addressable Code

## 1. Architectural Changes

a. Hash-Based Code Identification

Task: Develop a mechanism to generate unique hashes for each function and module based on their content.​

Approach: Utilize a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to compute hashes from the abstract syntax tree (AST) of each function or module. This ensures that semantically identical code produces the same hash, while any modification results in a different hash.​

### b. Immutable Code Definitions

Task: Enforce immutability by ensuring that once a function or module is defined and hashed, it cannot be altered.​

Approach: Implement a versioning system where any modification to existing code results in a new definition with a different hash. The original code remains unchanged, preserving system stability.​

### c. Decoupled Naming System

Task: Separate the naming of functions and modules from their content-based identifiers.​

Approach: Maintain a mapping between human-readable names and content hashes. This allows for renaming without affecting the underlying code or its references.​

### d. Content-Aware Execution Environment

Task: Develop or integrate an execution environment that understands and executes code based on its content-addressed structure.​

Approach: Modify the existing execution engine to retrieve and execute code using content hashes. This may involve changes to the interpreter or compiler to support hash-based code retrieval.​

## 1. Development Tasks

### a. Implement Hash Generation

Task: Create a utility to traverse the codebase, parse functions and modules into their ASTs, and compute their hashes.​

Approach: Utilize existing Haskell libraries to parse code and compute SHA-256 hashes from the ASTs. Store these hashes in a metadata repository.​

### b. Refactor Codebase for Immutability

Task: Modify the codebase to ensure that all code definitions are immutable.​
Approach: Implement a version control mechanism where updates to functions or modules create new definitions with new hashes, leaving existing code unchanged.​

### c. Develop Naming Metadata Repository

Task: Create a repository to map human-readable names to content hashes.​

Approach: Implement a database or a simple key-value store that maintains the association between names and hashes. Ensure that this repository is updated atomically to prevent inconsistencies.​

### d. Update Execution Engine

Task: Modify the execution engine to support content-addressable code execution.​

Approach: Refactor the engine to fetch and execute code based on content hashes. This may involve changes to the module loader and function invoker components.​

## 3. Testing Strategy

### a. Unit Testing

Task: Develop tests for individual components to ensure correct functionality.​

Approach: Write tests for hash generation, immutability enforcement, naming repository operations, and execution engine modifications. Use Haskell's testing frameworks to automate these tests.​

### b. Integration Testing

Task: Ensure that all components work together seamlessly.​

Approach: Develop tests that simulate real-world scenarios, such as adding new functions, updating existing ones, renaming, and executing code. Verify that the system behaves as expected in each case.​

### c. Performance Testing

Task: Assess the impact of the new system on performance.​

Approach: Measure the time taken for hash generation, code retrieval, and execution. Compare these metrics against the previous system to identify any performance regressions.​

### d. Security Testing

Task: Ensure that the system is secure against potential threats.​

Approach: Test for vulnerabilities such as hash collisions and unauthorized code modifications. Implement safeguards to mitigate these risks.​

## Conclusion

Implementing content-addressable code storage in the Time Bandits project involves significant architectural changes, including hash-based code identification, enforcing immutability, decoupling naming from code, and updating the execution environment. A structured approach encompassing development tasks and a comprehensive testing strategy is essential to ensure a successful transition. By following this plan, the project can achieve enhanced system integrity, simplified refactoring, and elimination of dependency conflicts.
