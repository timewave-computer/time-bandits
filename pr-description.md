# PR: Improve TEL Integration with Effect System

## Summary
This PR addresses several issues to improve the integration of the Temporal Effect Language (TEL) with the core effect system:

1. Verifies that `toEffect` correctly uses `CompositeEffect` for handling `SequenceEff`, `ParallelEff`, and `ChoiceEff`
2. Improves type safety and error handling in the TEL interpreter
3. Creates a test suite to verify the correct behavior of the `toEffect` function

## Changes

### Verify and Test `toEffect` Function
- Confirmed that `toEffect` correctly converts composite effects to `CompositeEffect`
- Created and ran tests to verify this functionality
- All tests pass, confirming correct implementation

### Type Safety Improvements
- Updated `VClosure` constructor to accept a list of `Identifier`s, fixing type mismatch errors
- Fixed the `LambdaExpr` handler to properly bind arguments to parameters
- Made `applyFunction` safer by using `viaNonEmpty` instead of unsafe `head`
- Updated `VFunction` to use a polymorphic effect type for better compatibility
- Fixed string concatenation errors by properly converting between String and Text

## Known Issues and Future Work
Some linter errors still remain to be addressed in future PRs:

1. Operator pattern matching issues in `applyOperator`
2. Clock/time management issues with `incrementTime` function
3. ResourceInfo and Hash type conversion problems

These issues are documented in the `integration-status.md` file for future reference and follow-up work.

## Testing
- Created a standalone test to verify the correct behavior of `toEffect`
- All tests pass, confirming that composite effects are correctly translated to `CompositeEffect`

## Related Issues
- Resolves the task to ensure `toEffect` uses `CompositeEffect` instead of separate effect types
