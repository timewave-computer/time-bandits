feat(TEL): Fix REPL integration and improve code quality

This PR addresses several issues with the TEL Interpreter:

1. **REPL Integration Fix**: 
   - Added the `InternalError` constructor to the `InterpreterError` data type
   - Properly exported it for use in the REPL module
   - Fixed type compatibility issues between the REPL and Interpreter

2. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Fixed unused variable warnings by adding underscore prefixes
   - Cleaned up redundant imports to improve maintainability
   - Fixed overlapping patterns in the `applyOperator` function
   - Exported additional test functions for better testability

3. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the integration status document with current progress
   - Documented remaining work items and next steps
   - Added comprehensive testing verification details

These changes ensure that the TEL interpreter properly integrates with the rest of the system, particularly improving the REPL functionality for interactive development and testing.

The PR builds on previous work that fixed operator pattern matching and hash type conversions, completing the integration of the TEL interpreter with the Core effect system.

Remaining work includes expanding test coverage and cleaning up minor code quality issues, which will be addressed in future PRs.
