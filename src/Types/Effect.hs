Module: Types.Effect
Description: Core Effect type for the DAG model

This module defines the core Effect type that represents nodes in the effect DAG.
It depends on Types.EffectTypes and Types.EffectPayload for its basic structures,
but doesn't depend on any Core or Programs modules, making it suitable for use
by both Core and Programs modules without creating circular dependencies.

The Effect type is designed to:
- Be content-addressed (identifiable by hash)
- Track causal relationships between effects
- Record external facts that were observed during execution
- Support a wide variety of operations via the EffectPayload
