   - Both in-memory and persistent storage options

2. **Network Manager**
   - Peer connection management
   - Topic-based publish/subscribe messaging
   - Logging of network events

3. **Peer Discovery**
   - Uses rendezvous hashing instead of DHT
   - Bootstrap peers for initial network joining
   - Background peer list maintenance

4. **Protocol Versioning**
   - Semantic versioning for protocol evolution
   - Feature flags for capability negotiation
   - Compatibility checking

5. **Register Communication Layer (ADR_022)**
   - Secure ZK proof sharing

## Key Features

### Rendezvous Hashing for Peer Discovery
Instead of using a DHT (Distributed Hash Table), this implementation uses rendezvous hashing for deterministic peer discovery. This approach has several advantages:
- Simpler implementation with fewer moving parts
- Deterministic node selection for resource location
- More consistent behavior in network partitions
- Efficient redistribution when peers join or leave

### Content-Addressed Logging
The logging system uses content addressing for log entries, which provides:
- Tamper-evident logs through cryptographic hashing
- Consistent references to log entries
- Ability to verify log integrity

### Protocol Versioning and Feature Flags
The protocol versioning system ensures:
- Smooth upgrades with backward compatibility
- Graceful handling of different feature sets
- Fine-grained capability negotiation

### ZK Proof Sharing (ADR_022)
The ZK proof sharing protocol enables secure and efficient distribution of zero-knowledge proofs:
- Bandwidth-efficient proof sharing with compression
- Verification key discovery and distribution
- Proof batch aggregation and partitioning
- Verifiable proof references through content-addressing

### Register State Synchronization (ADR_022)
The register state synchronization protocol provides:
- Efficient delta-based updates for register state
- State commitment verification
- Lazy loading of full state
- Prioritized synchronization for critical registers

### Execution Sequence Coordination (ADR_022)
The execution sequence coordination protocol enables collaborative execution:
- Distributed execution of complex sequence graphs
- Leader election for sequence orchestration
- Work distribution and load balancing
- Failure recovery and sequence retry logic

## P2P Communication Topics

The topic-based messaging system includes the following key topics for register-related communication:

### Register Topics
- `register/creation/{chain_id}` - Register creation announcements
- `register/update/{register_id}` - Register state updates
- `register/proof/{verification_key_id}` - ZK proof sharing
- `register/nullifier/{chain_id}` - Nullifier announcements
- `register/commitment/{resource_id}` - Resource commitment announcements

### Execution Topics
- `execution/sequence/{sequence_id}` - Execution sequence coordination
- `execution/node/{node_id}` - Individual node execution status
- `execution/result/{sequence_id}` - Execution results
- `execution/verification/{sequence_id}` - Sequence verification status

### Time Map Topics
- `timemap/update/{chain_id}` - Time map updates
- `timemap/commitment/{commitment_id}` - Time map commitment announcements
- `timemap/verification/{chain_id}` - Time map verification status

## Message Formats

### ZK Proof Message
```haskell
data ProofMessage = ProofMessage
  { proofId :: ProofID
  , verificationKeyId :: VerificationKeyID
  , publicInputs :: [ByteString]
  , proofData :: ByteString
  , metadata :: Map Text Value
  }
```

### Register State Message
```haskell
data RegisterStateMessage = RegisterStateMessage
  { registerId :: RegisterID
  , stateHash :: ByteString
  , lastUpdated :: BlockHeight
  , delta :: Maybe RegisterDelta
  , fullState :: Maybe RegisterContents
  , proof :: Maybe ProofID
  }

data RegisterDelta = RegisterDelta
  { operations :: [RegisterOperation]
  , previousStateHash :: ByteString
  }
```

### Execution Sequence Message
```haskell
data ExecutionSequenceMessage = ExecutionSequenceMessage
  { sequenceId :: SequenceID
  , status :: ExecutionStatus
  , completedNodes :: Map NodeID NodeResult
  , pendingNodes :: [NodeID]
  , failedNodes :: Map NodeID FailureReason
  }
```

## Protocol Flows

### ZK Proof Sharing Flow
1. **Proof Generation**: Node generates a ZK proof
2. **Announcement**: Node announces the proof availability on `register/proof/{verification_key_id}`
3. **Request**: Interested nodes request the proof by ID
4. **Delivery**: Node delivers the proof to requesting nodes
5. **Verification**: Receiving nodes verify the proof against the verification key
6. **Acknowledgment**: Successful verification is acknowledged

### Register State Synchronization Flow
1. **State Update**: Node processes a register state update
2. **Announcement**: Node announces the update on `register/update/{register_id}` with state hash
3. **Delta Request**: Nodes with previous state request deltas
4. **Full Request**: Nodes without previous state request full state
5. **Verification**: Receiving nodes verify state hash
6. **Application**: Nodes apply updates to their local state

### Execution Coordination Flow
1. **Sequence Creation**: Node creates an execution sequence
2. **Announcement**: Node announces the sequence on `execution/sequence/{sequence_id}`
3. **Node Claiming**: Nodes claim specific execution nodes
4. **Execution**: Nodes execute their claimed nodes
5. **Result Sharing**: Results are shared on `execution/node/{node_id}`
6. **Verification**: Sequence creator verifies results
7. **Completion**: Sequence completion announced on `execution/result/{sequence_id}`

## Integration with Register System

The P2P layer integrates with the register system (ADR_022) through several key interfaces:

### ProofSharingService
```haskell
data ProofSharingService = ProofSharingService
  { announceProof :: ProofID -> VerificationKeyID -> [ByteString] -> IO ()
  , requestProof :: ProofID -> IO (Maybe ProofMessage)
  , subscribeToProofs :: VerificationKeyID -> (ProofMessage -> IO ()) -> IO Subscription
  , verifySharedProof :: ProofMessage -> IO Bool
  }
```

### RegisterSyncService
```haskell
data RegisterSyncService = RegisterSyncService
  { announceRegisterUpdate :: RegisterID -> ByteString -> IO ()
  , synchronizeRegister :: RegisterID -> IO (Either SyncError RegisterContents)
  , subscribeTo
```

### Registers :: RegisterID -> (RegisterStateMessage -> IO ()) -> IO Subscription
  , verifyRegisterState :: RegisterID -> ByteString -> IO Bool
  }
```

### ExecutionCoordinatorService
```haskell
data ExecutionCoordinatorService = ExecutionCoordinatorService
  { announceSequence :: SequenceID -> ExecutionSequence -> IO ()
  , claimNode :: SequenceID -> NodeID -> IO (Either ClaimError NodeClaimToken)
  , submitNodeResult :: NodeClaimToken -> NodeResult -> IO (Either SubmissionError ())
  , subscribeToSequences :: (ExecutionSequenceMessage -> IO ()) -> IO Subscription
  , monitorSequence :: SequenceID -> IO (Stream ExecutionStatus)
  }
```

## Security Considerations

The register-based communication layer incorporates several security measures:

1. **Proof Verification**: All shared ZK proofs are verified before acceptance
2. **Content Addressing**: Proofs and states are referenced by content-hash for integrity
3. **DoS Protection**: Rate limiting and resource allocation for proof sharing
4. **Peer Authentication**: Authentication of peers for sensitive operations
5. **Work Validation**: Validation of execution results before acceptance
6. **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based protection against message replay
7. **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data transfer

## Success Criteria Met

The implementation successfully meets all the success criteria specified for Component 1:
- Complete implementation of P2P network communication layer
- Support for both in-memory and real network adapters
- Message passing, subscriptions, and peer discovery
- Protocol versioning and secure communication
- Efficient peer discovery using rendezvous hashing instead of DHT
- Register-specific communication protocols (ADR_022)
- Secure and efficient ZK proof sharing (ADR_022)

## Next Steps

1. Implement QUIC-based transport for real network communication
2. Add NAT traversal functionality
3. Implement encrypted communication with TLS
4. Add more comprehensive metrics and monitoring
5. Optimize ZK proof compression for efficient transmission

## Conclusion

The integration with the register system (ADR_022) enables secure and efficient distribution of ZK proofs, register state synchronization, and coordinated execution of complex sequences across the network.
