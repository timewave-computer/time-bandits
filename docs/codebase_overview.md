# Time Bandits: Codebase Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Time Bandits codebase structure, the key modules, and their dependencies. Understanding these relationships is essential for navigating the codebase and contributing effectively.

## Key Components

Time Bandits includes the following key components:

1. **Core Effect System**: The foundation for representing and managing temporal effects.
2. **Timeline Management**: Handling divergent timelines and their relationships.
3. **Resource Accounting**: Managing resources across timelines.
4. **TECL Language**: The Temporal Effect Combinator Language for declaring cross-timeline workflows.
5. **Schema Evolution**: Supporting schema changes across timeline evolutions.
6. **Program Model**: The programming model for creating time-aware applications.

## Architecture

Time Bandits is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns and minimizes coupling between subsystems:

## Module Dependencies

### Core Layer

The Core layer forms the foundation of the Time Bandits system:

```
Core/
├── Timeline.hs       # Timeline representation and operations
├── Resource.hs       # Resource management primitives
├── TimeMap.hs        # Timeline relationship tracking
├── Types.hs          # Fundamental type definitions
├── TECL.hs           # Temporal Effect Combinator Language parser and interpreter
├── Schema.hs         # Schema definition and evolution
├── Effect.hs         # Effect representation and processing
├── AccountProgram.hs # Account program implementation
├── Common.hs         # Common utilities and functions
├── Log.hs            # Logging infrastructure
├── CodeAddress.hs    # Content-addressable code storage
├── CodeAddressUtil.hs # Utilities for content-addressable code
└── Utils.hs          # General utility functions
```

**Dependencies**: None (except standard libraries)

### Content-Addressable Code System

The Content-Addressable Code system is a key architectural component that enables code immutability, eliminates dependency conflicts, and simplifies refactoring:

```
Core/
├── CodeAddress.hs       # Core content-addressable storage system
├── CodeAddressUtil.hs   # Utilities for working with content-addressable code
└── ...

Execution/
├── ContentAddressableExecutor.hs  # Execution engine for content-addressable code
└── ...
```

This system provides:

- **Hash-Based Identification**: Code is uniquely identified by its content hash
- **Immutable Code Storage**: Modifications create new versions with unique hashes
- **Decoupled Naming**: Names are metadata pointing to content hashes
- **Dependency Resolution**: Different versions of the same code can coexist

This design enables several powerful features:
- Dependencies are resolved with perfect precision
- Code can be reliably shared across different contexts
- Refactoring is safer and more straightforward
- Exact code versions are preserved indefinitely

└── Actor.hs          # Actor-related type definitions
```

**Dependencies**: None (except standard libraries)

## Dependency Guidelines

To maintain a clean architecture:

1. **Lower layers should not depend on higher layers**:
   - Core should not import from any other subsystem
   - Programs should only import from Core
   - Execution can import from Core and Programs
   - Adapters should only import from Core
   - Actors can import from Core, Programs, and Execution
   - Simulation can import from Core, Programs, Execution, and Actors
   - Proofs can import from Core, Programs, and Simulation
   - CLI can import from any subsystem

2. **Avoid circular dependencies**:
   - If module A imports module B, module B should not import module A
   - Use interface abstractions when bidirectional communication is needed

3. **Use typeclasses for abstraction**:
   - Define interfaces in lower layers
   - Implement in higher layers
   - Use dependency injection via the Effects system

4. **Keep imports explicit**:
   - Avoid wildcard imports (`import X.*`)
   - Name imports clearly (`import qualified X as X`)

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed through:

1. **The Cabal file**: External dependencies and version constraints
2. **The Nix flake**: Development environment with fixed dependency versions
3. **Module wiring**: Internal dependency relationships

By following these guidelines, we maintain a codebase that is modular, testable, and easy to understand and extend.
