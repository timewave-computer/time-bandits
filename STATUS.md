# Time Bandits Project Status

## Working Components

- **CLI.Deployment module** (standalone test in `test/standalone/cli-deployment`)
- **Fact Observation component** (standalone test in `test/standalone/fact-observation`)
- **TimeMap component** (standalone test in `test/standalone/time-map`)

## Current Issues

1. **Proofs.SecurityVerifier**:
   - Type mismatches with `getLogEntries`
   - Issues with `catch` and error handling
   - Missing string instances for `ProgramId` and `TimelineHash`

2. **Execution.EffectInterpreter**:
   - Type mismatches between `Effect` and `ExtendedEffect`
   - Issues with `LamportTime` type definitions
   - Missing constructors and functions

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing standalone components for critical functionality:
   - ResourceLedger
   - ExecutionLog
   - TECL Parser

2. Address the type system issues:
   - Systematically address type mismatches in SecurityVerifier
   - Resolve the Effect/ExtendedEffect conflict in EffectInterpreter
   - Fix the LamportTime inconsistencies

3. Complete missing implementations:
   - Implement missing constructors and imports
   - Add proper string instances for types like `ProgramId` and `TimelineHash`

## Progress Summary

We've successfully isolated and tested three key components of the Time Bandits system:

1. **CLI.Deployment** - Handles deployment configuration for scenarios
2. **Fact Observation** - Implements rules for extracting and validating facts from blockchain data
3. **TimeMap** - Manages timeline relationships and provides a graph structure for tracking timelines

These components now work in standalone mode, making them usable independently of the rest of the system while the remaining issues are being fixed. All standalone tests have been moved to the `test/standalone` directory for better organization.
