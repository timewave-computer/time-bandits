# Work Plan: Resource Formalization and ZK Register Implementation

## Background Context

This work plan outlines the implementation strategy for the resource formalization model described in [ADR_018: Resource Formalization](../docs/adr_018_resource_formalization.md) and the ZK-based register system described in [ADR_022: ZK Registers](../docs/adr_022_zk_registers.md). 

The combination of resource formalization and the ZK register system introduces several transformative enhancements to the Time Bandits architecture:

1. **Formalized Resource Definition**: Resources are defined as tuples with formal properties, including resource logic, fungibility domain, quantity, metadata, and mechanisms for tracking consumption.

2. **Resource Conservation Laws**: All operations must maintain resource conservation (Î”TX = 0), providing mathematical guarantees that resources are neither created nor destroyed inappropriately.

3. **Register-Based Resource Ownership**: Resources are held in registers with clear ownership boundaries, controlled through formally verified register operations.

4. **ZK Verification of Operations**: Register operations are verified using zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring correctness while preserving privacy.

5. **Controller Pattern**: Timelines are formalized through controllers with explicit classification (Safe, Live, Byzantine), enabling clearer security models.

6. **Controller Labels**: Resources transferred across timelines maintain a controller history, tracking provenance and enabling ancestry validation.

7. **Dual Validation**: Cross-timeline operations undergo both temporal validation (via time maps) and ancestral validation (via controller labels), providing defense in depth.

8. **Time Map Commitments**: Time maps are stored in registers and verified with ZK proofs, enabling on-chain verification of temporal relationships.

9. **Execution Sequences**: Complex workflows across chains can be orchestrated through execution sequences with dependencies and proofs.

This implementation represents a fundamental transformation of the Time Bandits architecture, touching every component of the system. The work will proceed in five phases, each building on the previous one.

## Technical Approach

### Register Data Structure

The register system uses the following core data structures:

```haskell
data Register = Register
    { registerId :: RegisterID
    , owner :: Address
    , contents :: RegisterContents
    , lastUpdated :: BlockHeight
    , metadata :: Map Text Value
    , controllerLabel :: Maybe ControllerLabel
    }

data RegisterContents 
    = FormalizedResource Resource
    | TokenBalance TokenType Address Amount
    | NFTContent CollectionAddress TokenId
    | StateCommitment CommitmentType ByteString
    | TimeMapCommitment BlockHeight ByteString
    | DataObject DataFormat ByteString
    | EffectDAG EffectID ByteString
    | ResourceNullifier NullifierKey ByteString
    | ResourceCommitment CommitmentKey ByteString
    | CompositeContents [RegisterContents]
```

### Authorization Method

Register operations will be authorized through various methods:

```haskell
data AuthorizationMethod
    = ZKProofAuthorization VerificationKey Proof
    | TokenOwnershipAuthorization TokenAddress Amount
    | NFTOwnershipAuthorization CollectionAddress TokenId
    | MultiSigAuthorization [Address] Int [Signature]
    | DAOAuthorization DAOAddress ProposalId
    | TimelockAuthorization Address Timestamp
    | CompositeAuthorization [AuthorizationMethod] AuthCombinator
```

### Register Operation

Register operations follow this structure:

```haskell
data RegisterOperation = RegisterOperation
    { opType :: OperationType
    , registers :: [RegisterID]
    , newContents :: Maybe RegisterContents
    , authorization :: Authorization
    , proof :: Proof
    , resourceDelta :: Delta
    }
```

### ZK Proof System

The ZK proof system will initially use a mock implementation for development and testing:

```haskell
-- Mock ZK system key-value store
data MockZKStore = MockZKStore
  { verificationKeys :: Map VerificationKey CircuitType
  , proofPairs :: Map VerificationKey ProofData
  , validationResults :: Map (ProofData, ByteString) Bool
  }

-- Generate mock proof
generateMockProof :: TimeMap -> VerificationKey -> IO ProofData
mockProve :: TimeMap -> ByteString -> VerificationKey -> ProofData -> IO Bool
```

This will later be replaced with real ZK proof systems such as Circom/Snarkjs, Plonk, or Groth16.

### Execution Sequence

Execution sequences will orchestrate complex workflows:

```haskell
data ExecutionSequence = ExecutionSequence
    { sequenceId :: SequenceID
    , nodes :: Map NodeID ExecutionNode
    , edges :: [Edge]
    , entryPoints :: [NodeID]
    , exitPoints :: [NodeID]
    , commitment :: ByteString
    }

data ExecutionNode = ExecutionNode
    { nodeId :: NodeID
    , nodeType :: NodeType
    , operation :: Operation
    , registerDependencies :: [RegisterID]
    , completionProof :: Maybe Proof
    , metadata :: Map Text Value
    }
```

### Implementation Constraints

1. **Register ID Generation**: For each blockchain, register creation must use a single function that increments an integer register identifier to ensure uniqueness and sequential ordering.

2. **Data Availability Requirements**: Transactions referencing data posted to a timeline's data availability layer must include a copy of that data, as it cannot be referenced for an on-chain program to read.

3. **ZK Circuit Complexity**: Circuits must be designed with gas cost optimization in mind, balanced against security requirements.

4. **Cross-Chain Coordination**: Register transfers across chains require careful coordination to maintain resource conservation.

5. **Sequential Consistency**: Operations must maintain causal consistency, especially across timelines.

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| ZK proof generation performance | Start with mock system, optimize real implementation iteratively |
| Register ID collision | Ensure single source of ID generation per chain |
| Cross-chain coordination failure | Implement robust recovery mechanisms and monitoring |
| Circuit security vulnerabilities | Conduct thorough audits and use formal verification |
| Migration challenges | Create comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities |
| User experience complexity | Focus on developer tools and documentation |
| Gas cost optimization | Benchmark and optimize all on-chain verification |

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: ZK proof generation and verification with acceptable latency
2. **Security**: Successful security audits with no critical findings
3. **Developer Experience**: Positive feedback from developers using the system
4. **Gas Efficiency**: On-chain verification costs within specified targets
5. **Cross-Chain Operations**: Reliable cross-chain register transfers with dual validation
6. **Resource Conservation**: Mathematical guarantees maintained across all operations
7. **System Integration**: Seamless integration with all Time Bandits components

## Dependencies

1. **ZK Proof Libraries**: Integration with production-ready ZK proof systems
2. **Blockchain Adapters**: Support for register operations in all target blockchains
3. **Temporal Effect Language**: Language extensions for register operations
4. **Effect Pipeline**: Updates to support register operations and ZK verification
5. **Time Map System**: Integration with register-based time commitments
6. **Execution Sequencer**: Implementation of partial order execution framework

## Conclusion

The implementation of the resource formalization model and ZK register system represents a fundamental transformation of the Time Bandits architecture. By combining formalized resources, registers, ZK proofs, and execution sequences, we create a powerful framework for secure, verifiable cross-chain operations with strong mathematical guarantees. This work plan outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing this vision, with careful attention to performance, security, and developer experience.
